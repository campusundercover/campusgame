# 🕵️‍♂️ Campus Undercover: The Christ Mystery

A real-time multiplayer 3D social deduction and social investigation game set inside the **Christ University Central Campus** (Bengaluru). Built for a multiplayer experience, the game splits players into Investigators (led by a Detective) and Villains (a Mastermind and their Conspirator accomplice) as they race against time to solve or cover up a campus conspiracy.

The application leverages a high-performance **FastAPI** backend with asynchronous WebSockets, an immersive **React-Three-Fiber (Three.js)** 3D frontend, and a persistent **PostgreSQL** database.

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The game utilizes a stateful client-server design where real-time player positioning, NPC actions, and evidence collection are synchronized instantly via WebSockets:

## 🎮 Game Concept & Mechanics

### 🕵️ Role Dynamics

| Role | Faction | Primary Objective & Abilities |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Detective** | **Investigators** | Collect clues, view CCTV surveillance, correlate items on the Evidence Board, and accuse the culprits. <br>• *Abilities*: `CCTV_ANALYSIS`, `CORRELATE_EVIDENCE`, `DIGITAL_ANALYSIS`, `RECOVER_LOGS` |
| **Bystander / Investigator** | **Investigators** | Patrol the campus, complete support tasks, and report suspicious activities. <br>• *Tasks*: Repair network terminals, archive departmental records, test security hardware. |
| **Mastermind** | **Villains** | Coordinate the cover-up, manipulate campus witnesses, plant fake clues, and destroy incriminating evidence. <br>• *Abilities*: `DESTROY_EVIDENCE`, `PLANT_FAKE_EVIDENCE`, `MANIPULATE_NPC`, `TRIGGER_MEETING` |
| **Conspirator** | **Villains** | Act as the Mastermind's accomplice to confuse the Detective, plant fake evidence, frame innocent players, and block key perimeters. <br>• *Abilities*: `FRAME_PLAYER`, `SECURE_PERIMETER`, `CREATE_ALIBI` |

## 🌟 Core Features Implemented

### 1. Immersive 3D Campus Layout (React-Three-Fiber)
*   **Faithful Map Layout**: A complete digital twin of Christ University's Central Campus containing **24 custom-modeled locations** including the *Central Block*, *Audi Block*, *Computer Lab*, *Research Center*, *MCA Department*, *Sitting Areas*, *Hockey/Basketball Courts*, and *Hostels*.
*   **Intuitive Controls**: Implemented WASD keyboard movement, mouse camera yaw rotation, sprinting modifiers, and virtual joystick controllers for mobile-compatible browsers.
*   **Interactive Entities**: Live 3D rendering of spawned evidence assets, player character models, and patroling NPC models.

### 2. Autonomous NPC Patrol & Observation Engine
*   **16 Patroling NPCs**: Features realistic characters (e.g., *Dr. Priya Nair*, *Librarian Ms. Stella*, *Chef Murugan*) representing Students, Faculty, Security, and Staff with individual walk speeds, idle timers, and distinct patrol path configurations.
*   **Behavioral Observation Log**: NPCs maintain a memory log of player behaviors (e.g., collecting/destroying evidence) occurring within their observation radii.
*   **Lying & Manipulation Mechanics**: Villains can prime NPCs using `MANIPULATE_NPC` or `FRAME_PLAYER` to feed misleading testimonies to the Detective.

### 3. Server-Side Surveillance CCTV Tracker
*   **Anonymized Logs**: Tracks player coordinates every 5 seconds, mapping players to 10 distinct, anonymous color blips (`COLOR_MAP`) to prevent meta-gaming.
*   **Surveillance Logs**: Detectives visiting the *Security Office* can request a CCTV Analysis report for a specific location over a time window.
*   **Playback Minimap**: Generates path data for client-side playback.

### 4. Evidence Correlation & Board System
*   **Evidence Board GUI**: A premium, custom glassmorphic interface where the Detective organizes collected physical, digital, and testimonial evidence.
*   **Correlation Rules**: Detectives link evidence nodes. The server evaluates if the nodes converge on the same suspect and calculates connection strengths.
*   **Tampering Warnings**: Difficulty-scaled detection probabilities determine if the Detective intercepts warning notifications on fabricated logs planted by the villains.

## 💾 Database Schema

The database uses PostgreSQL to save player registration credentials, active sessions, and historical game results.

```mermaid
erDiagram
    users {
        int id PK
        string username UNIQUE
        string email UNIQUE
        string hashed_password
        boolean is_active
        timestamp created_at
    }
    game_sessions {
        uuid id PK
        string status "waiting/playing/finished"
        string difficulty "easy/medium/hard"
        string winner_faction "INVESTIGATORS/VILLAINS"
        timestamp created_at
        timestamp ended_at
    }
    user_game_stats {
        int id PK
        int user_id FK
        uuid session_id FK
        string role "DETECTIVE/INVESTIGATOR/MASTERMIND/CONSPIRATOR"
        int evidence_collected

Spins up the complete environment including PostgreSQL, the FastAPI backend, and the Vite frontend.

```bash
# 1. Build and run containers in detached mode
docker-compose up --build -d

# 2. View streaming logs
docker-compose logs -f
```

*   **Frontend Client**: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
*   **Backend Server**: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
*   **API Interactive Documentation (OpenAPI)**: [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)

### 💻 Method B: Local Manual Execution

#### 1. Database Setup
Ensure PostgreSQL is running locally, create a database named `campusgame`, and update your environmental config files. Run migrations using Alembic:
```bash
cd backend
alembic upgrade head
```

#### 2. Running the Backend
1. Navigate to the backend folder:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # On Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # On Unix/macOS:
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Fire up the reload development server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
   ```

#### 3. Running the Frontend
1. Navigate to the frontend folder:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install npm packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Boot the Vite dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## 📡 WebSocket API Protocols

Communication during gameplay occurs over JSON packets with the following standard types:

### 📤 Client-to-Server Messages
*   `POSITION_UPDATE` / `PLAYER_MOVE`: Broadcast coordinates to synchronize movement animations.
*   `COLLECT_EVIDENCE`: Interact with evidence models in the proximity.
*   `RECORD_MOVEMENT`: Anonymized track logs sent every 5 seconds.
*   `USE_ABILITY`: Submit requests to use detective/villain abilities.
*   `NPC_INTERACT`: Retrieve statements from a proximal NPC.
*   `TASK_PROGRESS`: Submit progression on active Bystander tasks.
*   `CHAT_MESSAGE`: Send text to `public` or `villain` channels.
*   `SUBMIT_ACCUSATION`: Detective's final accusation.

### 📥 Server-to-Client Messages
*   `ROLE_REVEAL`: Displays the private role card on match start.
*   `GAME_STATE`: Personal list of abilities, assigned tasks, and public evidence.
*   `PLAYER_MOVED` / `PLAYER_DISCONNECTED`: Synchronizes remote coordinates and gracefully handles reconnections.
*   `EVIDENCE_COLLECTED` / `EVIDENCE_APPEARED` / `EVIDENCE_DESTROYED`: Live updates of evidence availability.
*   `CCTV_REPORT`: Delivers anonymous colored presence timelines to the detective.
*   `CORRELATION_RESULT`: Analysis results from evidence links.
*   `MEETING_STARTED` / `MEETING_ENDED`: Halts exploration and displays chat dialog overlays.
